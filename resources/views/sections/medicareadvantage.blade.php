                                offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide you with all your Part A
                                and Part B benefits. Medicare Advantage Plans include Health Maintenance Organizations,
                                Preferred Provider Organizations, Private Fee-for-Service Plans, Special Needs Plans, and
                                Medicare Medical Savings Account Plans. If youâ€™re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, most
                                Medicare services are covered through the plan that weren't covered by your original Medicare
                                plan.
